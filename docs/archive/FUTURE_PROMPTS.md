For my daily work I use a lot of LLMs and coding agentes. I mainly use claude web, gemini web, claude code and opencode on my cli, but I sometimes use others. I usually make a question or run a task in a fire-and-forget manner, and I come back to it when the output is ready or the system requires my intervention. In order to avoid the constant context-switching I want to have a single dashboard that tracks all the tasks that I've run on my coding agents and LLMs (even if they are prompts to a claude or gemni web), and notify me when one of them has finished or requires of my attention (maybe because I need to give some inputs and permissions). I am a CLI-first person, so the dashboard can be a CLI tool. Also, I use claude and gemini in the web browser but if for this tool some other setup is better let's explore it. Ideally, I was thinking the CLI could be written in Rust, but I am also open to other alternatives that you think are better suited for the task.
